Here are some instructions for running this starter code. 

### 1. [Clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your computer.
Once you've got it, [navigate to the directory](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html)
(ex: ``$ cd starter-code``)
### 2. [Make sure you have Node and npm installed.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 

Check to see if you can run  ``$ node -v`` and ``$ npm -v`` (My versions are v16.15.0 for node and 8.10.0 for npm.)
### 3. Install the Express module using npm. 
ex: ``$ npm install express``
### 4. Run the example app using Node:
ex: ``$ node App.js``

You should see the message ``Server is running on http://localhost:8000``

If you instead see an error message like ``Error: Cannot find module 'express'`` -- see step 3. 
### 5. View your website
Open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to this URL: ``http://localhost:8000/``

You should see a delicious and fabulously designed drawing app! Nice!
### 6. Make it your own!
